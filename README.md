# Wills-Grill
This was a collaborative effort of three group members.
A fictitious restaurant's website--created as a group effort in Web Design @UMSL
On this project, I had worked collaboratively with two other group members.  The home page was designed by myself and Ryan E. I also assised Ryan in documentation on the css page, as well as some of the css for his merch page.  I designed the contact page, borrowing from open-source material found online; this is a 'modified' version; I had some assistance with the css modifications from Ryan.  **The community support page has been borrowed from In-N-Out Burgers for this fictitious site, 'Will's Grill'.  Dreamweaver was used to create this fictitious website.  Collaboration was made possible by Cloud-9.
